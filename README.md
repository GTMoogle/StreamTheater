#StreamTheater

Stream Theater is a combination of [Moonlight](http://moonlight-stream.com) and Oculus Cinema for GearVR.  Like Moonlight, it is an open source project that uses NVIDIA's GameStream (TM) to stream your PC games to a virtual movie theater.

##Beta Installation

* Oculus requires GearVR apps to be signed.  You can generate a signature file for your phone here: [OculusVR Sig Generator](https://developer.oculus.com/osig/), and rebuild the project yourself or request someone else to generate it for you.
* Alternatively you can inject your signature here: [SideloadVR](http://www.sideloadvr.com/)


##Requirements

* [GameStream compatible](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) computer with GTX 600+ series GPU
* Samsung Note 4 or S6 with GearVR headset
* High-end wireless router (802.11n dual-band recommended)

##Usage

* Turn on GameStream in the GFE settings
* When on the same network as your PC, open Moonlight and tap on your PC in the list
* Accept the pairing confirmation on your PC
* Tap your PC again to view the list of apps to stream
* Select a theater
